## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Team Members

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davids2510/2025-intro-swe.git
   cd 2025-intro-swe/projects/rezerviraj.me-dsiroglavic-mbudimir
   ```

2. **Set up your environment**:
   Use Codespaces or Devcontainer with local VS Code.

3. **Create your feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
   ```

### For Instructors/Reviewers

1. View our project documentation below
2. Check our GitHub Issues for project planning
3. Review our Pull Requests for collaboration process

## 🔄 Pair Programming Workflow

### Daily Routine

1. **Start of Day (5 minutes)**
   - Sync with partner: Discuss goals and who's driving/navigating
   - Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
   - Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]`

2. **During Development**
   - **Driver**: Writes the code (types)
   - **Navigator**: Reviews code, thinks ahead, catches issues
   - **Switch roles** every 25-30 minutes (Pomodoro technique)
   - **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages

3. **End of Day (10 minutes)**
   - **Push your branch**: `git push origin feature/[feature-name]`
   - **Create Pull Request** to main branch
   - **Partner reviews** the PR (must be approved by both team members)
   - **Merge to main** after both approve

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Protected branch for final, working code
- `feature/[feature-name]`: Individual feature branches
- All work happens on feature branches, never directly on main

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create PR** from feature branch to main
2. **Both team members must review** and approve
3. **Use the PR template** (see below)
4. **Merge only after** both approvals and CI passes
